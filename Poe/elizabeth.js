Little Elizabeth,
    Why so sad at heart?
Games we could not play,
    Songs we could not start;
Careless, idle boy,
    Shall I cease to sport?
Shall I cease to laugh
    With thee in the court?

Tell me, dearest child,
    Shall I no more smile?
Shall the eyelids shine,
    Heavy on the eyel?
Shall we no more speak
    Words in gentle glee?
Shall we see no more
    Golden hours, just we?

Or shall we still find
    Joy in youthful things,
In the wild-rose field,
    In the breath of springsâ€”
In the drift of days,
    In the sun-lit air,
Elizabeth, still,
    Shall we find thee fair?
