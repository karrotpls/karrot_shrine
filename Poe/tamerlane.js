Kind solace in a dying hour!
  Such, father, is not (now) my theme—
I will not madly deem that power
  Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
  Unearthly pride hath revelled in—
I have no time to dote or dream:
You call it hope—that fire of fire!
It is but agony of desire:
If I can hope—O God! I can—
  Its fount is holier—more divine—
I would not call thee fool, old man,
  But such is not a gift of thine.

Know thou the secret of a spirit
  Bowed from its wild pride into shame.
O yearning heart! I did inherit
  Thy withering portion with the fame,
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the Jewels of my throne,
Halo of Hell! and with a pain
Not Hell shall make me fear again—
O craving heart, for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours!
The undying voice of that dead time,
  With its interminable chime,
Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
Upon thy emptiness—a knell.

I have not always been as now:
  The fevered diadem on my brow
I claimed and won usurpingly—
  Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
  Rome to the Cæsar—this to me?
  The heritage of a kingly mind,
And a proud spirit which hath striven
  Triumphantly with human kind.

On mountain soil I first drew life:
  The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head,
And I believe the wingèd strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair.

So late from Heaven—that dew—it fell
  (Mid dreams of an unholy night)
Upon me with the touch of Hell,
  While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung, like banners, o’er,
Appeared to my half-closing eye
  The pageantry of monarchy;
And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
Came hurriedly upon me, telling
  Of human battle, where my voice,
  My own voice, silly child!—was swelling
  (O! how my spirit would rejoice,
And leap within me at the cry)
The battle-cry of Victory!

The rain came down upon my head
  Unsheltered—and the heavy wind
  Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
It was but man, I thought, who shed
Laurels upon me—and the rush—
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires—with the captive’s prayer—
The hum of suitors—and the tone
Of flattery round a sovereign’s throne.

My passions, from that hapless hour,
  Usurped a tyranny which men
  Have deemed, since I have reached to power,
  My innate nature—be it so:
But, father, there lived one who, then,
  Then—in my boyhood—when their fire
Burned with a still intenser glow,
  (For passion must, with youth, expire)
E'en then who knew this iron heart
  In woman’s weakness had a part.

I have no words—alas!—to tell
The loveliness of loving well!
Nor would I now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
Are—shadows on th’ unstable wind:
Thus I remember having dwelt
  Some page of early lore upon,
With loitering eye, till I have felt
The letters—with their meaning—melt
  To fantasies—with none.

O, she was worthy of all love!
  Love—as in infancy was mine—
’Twas such as angel minds above
  Might envy; her young heart the shrine
On which my every hope and thought
  Were incense—then a goodly gift,
  For they were childish and upright—
Pure—as her young example taught:
Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
Trust to the fire within, for light?

We grew in age—and love—together—
  Roaming the forest and the wild;
My breast her shield in wintry weather—
  And, when the friendly sunshine smiled,
And she would mark the opening skies,
  I saw no Heaven—but in her eyes.

Young Love’s first lesson is—the heart:
  For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
When, from our little cares apart,
  And laughing at her girlish wiles,
I’d throw me on her throbbing breast,
  And pour my spirit out in tears—
There was no need to speak the rest—
  No need to quiet any fears
Of her—who asked no reason why,
But turned on me her quiet eye!

Yet more than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with, and strove,
When, on the mountain peak, alone,
Ambition lent it a new tone—
I had no being—but in thee:
  The world, and all it did contain
In the earth—the air—the sea—
Its joy—its little lot of pain
  That was new pleasure—the ideal,
Dim, vanities of dreams by night—

I feared not them—I feared not thee,
  Nor any thing which is to be!
Yes! in thy spirit I could view
  A third and brighter world than this,
Where thou and I and Liberty
  Had equal realm, and rule, and bliss.

*

Alas!—how changed that spirit, now!
Thou dost not—darest not look on me!
Love’s burning blush hath left thy brow,
And, weakly, thou dost turn to flee,
And timidly, thou speak’st of shame
  And gradually sinkest—down
  Thy gently sinking—tone of voice—
That once could make all hearts rejoice—
  Wake terror, and defy control—
And now it trembles to a moan—
  An echo of the soul!

*

Thou wert not sent for to the tomb—
Thus, sooner—only to perfume
With thy sweet voice, the calm of death;
Heaven gave thee to me, to bless
  The heart that loved thee—lone and blind,
With a spirit far too mad to bless,
  With a heart too wild to find.
