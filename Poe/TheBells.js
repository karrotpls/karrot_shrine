Hear the sledges with the bells—
    Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
    How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
        In the icy air of night!
    While the stars that oversprinkle
    All the heavens, seem to twinkle
        With a crystalline delight;
        Keeping time, time, time,
        In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
        Bells, bells, bells—
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

... [poem continues through 4 stanzas] ...

They are neither man nor woman—
    They are neither brute nor human—
        They are Ghouls:
And their king it is who tolls;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
            Rolls
A paean from the bells!
And his merry bosom swells
With the paean of the bells!
And he dances, and he yells;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the paean of the bells—
Of the bells:
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the throbbing of the bells—
Of the bells, bells, bells—
To the sobbing of the bells;
Keeping time, time, time,
As he knells, knells, knells,
In a happy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells—
            Of the bells, bells, bells—
To the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells—
            Bells, bells, bells—
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
