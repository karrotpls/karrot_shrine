'Twas noontide of summer, and mid-way 'twixt noon
And twilight, sat the queenly Evening Star.
She gleamed along with a tranquil light—a boon
To him who had journeyed far;
For he, of all who had roamed that day's vast noon,
Was blinded by the splendour of her ray—
Yet ever, as she tipped the horizon's marge,
She soothed him with her faint, but lovely ray.

Serene—in faith serene—returning night
Drew slowly toward the day;
And still that star, in gemlike set so bright,
Kept faith with the fading day;
Until, at length, the world grew pale and fair,
And every star, as echo to her prayer,
Came trembling through the sky—
Then, set apart, so sweet that even the air
Seemed hushed as hymned—to her gentle sway
Of beauty, breathless rose that lovely Star away.
